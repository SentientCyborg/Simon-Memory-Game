# Simon-Memory-Game
This is a basic "Simon" style memory game coded in JavaScript. It was coded as an assignment for a web dev course. The basic idea 
of the game is for a player to click the color the page shows. If the player gets the color right, the page will show a new color. 
The player then needs to select the first and second colors in sequence, etc.

This code uses jquery and is pretty similar to the final soloution presented by the instructor. I ended up breaking the code down into some additional
functions to improve readability.
